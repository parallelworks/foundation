# @parallelworks/lint

Biome rules for React apps localized with `use-intl`: text a person reads comes from the locale catalog, never a string literal.

- `ui-text.json` (`@parallelworks/lint/biome`): turns on Biome's [`style/noJsxLiterals`](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/no-jsx-literals/) as an error, allowing separators such as `·`, `/`, `—` and `→`, the dotted ellipses `···` and `⋯`, and their HTML entities. It catches JSX text: `<p>Hello</p>`.
- `ui-text.grit`: a Biome plugin for what that rule leaves out:
  - string children in braces: `{'Hello'}`, `` {`Welcome ${name}`} ``
  - display props: `label`, `title`, `placeholder`, `alt`, `tooltip`, `description`, `text`, `message`, `hint`, the `aria-*` text attributes, and any prop named for what it shows, such as `submitLabel`, `emptyText`, `errorMessage` or `namePlaceholder` (example placeholders such as `https://example.com` or `localhost` are fine)
  - display properties of objects, as in column, option and form definitions: `{ label: 'Name' }`, `{ header: 'Status' }`, `{ description: '...' }` (CSS class strings such as `'mb-1 flex'` and sample values such as `'1Gi'` or `'user@example.com'` are fine)
  - toasts: `toast('Saved')`, `toast.success(...)`, `.info`, `.warning`, `.error`, `.loading`

  In children, props and object properties, it also looks inside `c ? 'Open' : 'Closed'`, `c && 'Shown'` and parentheses. A template literal counts only when its literal parts have words, so `` `${user}/${name}` `` is fine.

## Use

```sh
pnpm add -D @parallelworks/lint
```

```json
{
  "extends": ["@parallelworks/lint/biome"],
  "plugins": ["./node_modules/@parallelworks/lint/ui-text.grit"]
}
```

Biome resolves a plugin's path from the config that lists it, so the app names the plugin itself. In a monorepo, point at the package's `node_modules` (for example `./packages/web/node_modules/@parallelworks/lint/ui-text.grit`) and scope it with `overrides`.

Text that must stay as is, such as a product name or a code sample, takes Biome's own suppression with a reason:

```tsx
{/* biome-ignore lint/style/noJsxLiterals: product name */}
<span>ACTIVATE Platform</span>
{/* biome-ignore lint/plugin: product name */}
<Logo alt='ACTIVATE Platform' />
```
